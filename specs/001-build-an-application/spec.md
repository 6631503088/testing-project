 # Feature Specification: Photo Album Organizer Application
 
 **Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`  
 **Created**: September 22, 2025  
 **Status**: Draft  
 **Input**: User description: "Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface."
 
 ## Execution Flow (main)
 ```
 1. Parse user description from Input
 2. Extract key concepts from description
	 → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
 3. For each unclear aspect:
	 → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
 4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
 5. Generate Functional Requirements
	 → Each requirement must be testable
	 → Mark ambiguous requirements
 6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
 7. Run Review Checklist
	 → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	 → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
 8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
 ```

 ## User Scenarios & Testing
 
 ### Primary User Story
 A user wants to organize their personal photos into albums that are grouped by date. On the main page, the user can drag and drop albums to re-organize their order. Within each album, the user can view photo previews in a tile-like interface.
 
 ### Acceptance Scenarios
 1. **Given** a collection of photos, **When** the user creates a new album for a specific date, **Then** the album is displayed on the main page grouped by that date.
 2. **Given** multiple albums on the main page, **When** the user drags and drops an album to a new position, **Then** the album order updates accordingly and persists.
 3. **Given** an album with photos, **When** the user views the album, **Then** the photos are shown as tiles for easy preview.
 
 ### Edge Cases
 - What happens when a user tries to create an album with no photos?
 - How does the system handle duplicate albums for the same date?
 - What if a user attempts to drag an album outside the allowed area?
 - How does the system handle very large photo collections?
 
 ## Requirements
 
 ### Functional Requirements
 - **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create photo albums grouped by date.
 - **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to re-organize albums by dragging and dropping on the main page.
 - **FR-003**: System MUST prevent albums from being nested within other albums.
 - **FR-004**: System MUST display photo previews in a tile-like interface within each album.
 - **FR-005**: System MUST persist the order of albums after re-organization.
 - **FR-006**: System MUST handle empty albums gracefully [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should empty albums be allowed or prompt user to add photos?]
 - **FR-007**: System MUST handle duplicate albums for the same date [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should duplicates be merged, prevented, or allowed?]
 - **FR-008**: System MUST support large photo collections [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is there a performance or storage limit?]
 
 ### Key Entities
 - **Album**: Represents a collection of photos grouped by a specific date. Attributes: date, name, list of photos, order.
 - **Photo**: Represents an individual image. Attributes: image file, preview thumbnail, associated album.
